A novel algorithm allows to incorporate automatically any possible features dependencies or interactions. Unlike independent models, Naive Bayes for instance, this algorithm takes into account possible dependencies between features. What makes this algorithm stand above the current models is the fact that the dependency incorporation is done in an unsupervised manner. Bayesian networks rely on learning the model parameters such as the structure of dependencies as well as the strength of the dependencies. However, this new algorithm integrate out every possible choice of dependencies.
